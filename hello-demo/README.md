helloServer.py
* listens on any:50001 for incoming TCP connection
* when a client connects, it,
** sends "hello"
** then pauses 1/4s,
** then sends "world"

helloClient.py
* by default: connects to localhost:500001
* after connecting:
** if a delay of n is specified, it sleeps for n seconds (otherwise no sleep)
** repeatedly reads from the socket and prints what it rec'd, until EOF
